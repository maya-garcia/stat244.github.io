title: "STAT 244-SC"

Here I will be talking more about my Final Project in my class, stat-244-sc! I am doing a Final Project in collaboration with Hjordis Aho.

For our final project, we choose HSB2 dataset which is a dataset containing 200 randomly sampled responses from a survey conducted by the National Center of Education Statsistics. The survey titled “High School and Beyond” was conducted on high school seniors.

We will be researching students' standardized writing scores and looking at four predictor variables which are: standardized reading score, socio economic status of student's family, type of school, and type of program they are in.

Here are some data visualization of our predictor variables and how they compare with our response variable.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
hsb2=read.csv("hsb2.csv")
head(hsb2)
ggplot(hsb2, aes(x = read,y=write)) + geom_line(col = "lightblue") + labs( y= "Writing Score", x = "Reading Score")+ theme_classic()
ggplot(hsb2, aes(x = ses,y=write)) + geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue") + labs( y= "Writing Score", x = "Socioeconomic Status")+ theme_classic()
ggplot(hsb2, aes(x = schtyp,y= write)) + geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue") + labs(y = "Writing Score", x = "School Type")+ theme_classic()
ggplot(hsb2, aes(x = prog,y= write)) + geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue") + labs(y = "Writing Score", x = "Program Type")+ theme_classic()
```
